#Peter Finnerty - Week 7 Task.

#Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.
#The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line.

#   Î» w7numberofes.py
#   C:\Users\finne\Desktop\Scripting\w7numberofes.py is designed to count 
#   occurances of the letter 'e' in a text file.

#   Enter a text file name: w7moby-dick.txt

#   Occurrences of the uppercase letter 'E':       1363
#   Occurrences of the lowercase letter 'e':     116960
#   Occurances of both uppercase and lowercase:  118323
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Inform user of program name and function.

#Creat variables U2 and L2 - to be used in 'for' loops.
